    <p>I am a full stack developer based out of Northern California. In my childhood I had an unhealthy obsession with
        video games and computers that developed into a healthy obsession with software engineering.</p>
    <p>Starting out as a self taught developer I realized there was a lot for me to learn. Upon this realization I
        quickly signed up for the UC Davis coding bootcamp where I became proficient in languages like HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and Python.</p>

    <p>I am looking for a company that will allow me to develop my skills even further and continue to educate myself in
        the ever-changing world of software engineering.
