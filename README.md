My personal website
=======
A good look at my possibilities.

Took a while to get everything lined up how I wanted. 

getting the footer to appear as I wanted proved to be difficult. 

the name wouldn't remain as I wanted but I can fix that in bootstrap. 

probably shouldn't have used a list to display the navbar but I have already fixed that with my second try with bootstrap. 

links act weird on hover.
